Hi! I'm a researcher at Helmut Schmidt University in Hamburg, Germany, working toward my PhD. My research is focused on the __generalization__ capabilities and __robustness__ of __AI__ models. Within this broad domain, I specialize in __time series data__ derived from __cyber-physical systems__, exploring innovative techniques that can address challenges in this field. My research aims to enhance our comprehension of complex systems and create practical solutions that can make a real difference in the field of artificial intelligence. Whether you're interested in collaboration, have specific questions, or share a passion for these topics, I'd love to connect!
